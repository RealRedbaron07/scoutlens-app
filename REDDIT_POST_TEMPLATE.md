### Title:
```
I built a tool to find undervalued football players using Transfermarkt + xG data
```

### Body:
```
Hey r/soccer,

I've been working on ScoutLens - a tool that combines real Transfermarkt market values with xG/xA analytics to identify undervalued players.

**How it works:**
- Uses actual Transfermarkt values (not estimates)
- Combines with xG/xA per 90 stats
- Applies age curve and league multipliers
- Highlights players where market value < fair value

**Features:**
- Search 300+ players across 25+ leagues
- Filter by league, position, age, value
- Compare players side-by-side
- Track transfer rumors
- Export data (Pro feature)

**Example findings:**
- Esteban Lepaul (Rennes): Market €15M, Fair €44M (+195%)
- [Add 2-3 more examples from your app]

**Try it free:** https://scoutlens-app.vercel.app

No signup required. Works on mobile and desktop.

I'd love feedback on:
- What features are missing?
- Which leagues should I add?
- What data would be most useful?

Thanks!
```

**Posting Tips:**
- Post during peak hours (7-9 AM or 6-8 PM UK time)
- Engage with every comment (be helpful, not salesy)
- If removed, try r/fantasypl or r/footballmanagergames
- Don't post too frequently (1x per week max)

## r/fantasypl Post (200K members)

### Title:
```
I built a tool to find undervalued FPL players using xG data
```

### Body:

Hey r/fantasypl,

I built ScoutLens - a tool that finds undervalued players using Transfermarkt values + xG/xA analytics.

**Why it's useful for FPL:**
- Find hidden gems before price rises
- Compare players by xG/xA per 90
- See which players are undervalued vs market
- Track contract expiries (bargain signings)

**Example:**
- [Player] is valued at €[X]M but xG says he's worth €[Y]M
- Perfect for your wildcard?

**Try it free:** https://scoutlens-app.vercel.app

Works on mobile. No signup required.

What FPL-specific features would be most useful?
```

**Posting Tips:**
- Focus on FPL angle (price, fixtures, form)
- Post during FPL active periods (gameweek starts)
- Engage with FPL community
