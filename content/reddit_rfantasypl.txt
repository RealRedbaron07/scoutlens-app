I built a tool to find undervalued FPL players using xG data

BODY:
Hey r/fantasypl,

I built ScoutLens - a tool that finds undervalued players using Transfermarkt values + xG/xA analytics.

**Why it's useful for FPL:**
- Find hidden gems before price rises
- Compare players by xG/xA per 90
- See which players are undervalued vs market
- Track contract expiries (bargain signings)

**Example:**
- Esteban Lepaul is valued at €15M but xG says he's worth €44.3M
- Perfect for your wildcard?

**Try it free:** https://scoutlens-app.vercel.app

Works on mobile. No signup required.

What FPL-specific features would be most useful?
