TITLE:
I built a tool to find undervalued football players using Transfermarkt + xG data

---

BODY:
Hey r/soccer,

I've been working on ScoutLens - a tool that combines real Transfermarkt market values with xG/xA analytics to identify undervalued players.

**How it works:**
- Uses actual Transfermarkt values (not estimates)
- Combines with xG/xA per 90 stats
- Applies age curve and league multipliers
- Highlights players where market value < fair value

**Features:**
- Search 300+ players across 25+ leagues
- Filter by league, position, age, value
- Compare players side-by-side
- Track transfer rumors
- Export data (Pro feature)

**Example findings:**
- Esteban Lepaul (Stade Rennais FC 1901): Market €15M, Fair €44.3M (+195%)
- Antoine Semenyo (AFC Bournemouth): Market €28M, Fair €80.5M (+188%)
- Aune Heggebø (West Bromwich Albion FC): Market €6M, Fair €17.2M (+187%)

**Try it free:** https://scoutlens-app.vercel.app

No signup required. Works on mobile and desktop.

I'd love feedback on:
- What features are missing?
- Which leagues should I add?
- What data would be most useful?

Thanks!
