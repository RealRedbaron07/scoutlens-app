BODY:
Hey r/footballmanagergames,

I built ScoutLens - a scouting tool that uses real Transfermarkt values + xG data to find undervalued players.

**Why it's useful for FM:**
- Find hidden gems before they're expensive
- Compare players by xG/xA per 90
- See which players are undervalued vs market
- Track contract expiries (free transfers)
- Export data to CSV for your own analysis

**Example:**
- Esteban Lepaul is valued at €15M but xG says he's worth €44.3M
- Perfect for your lower league save?

**Try it free:** https://scoutlens-app.vercel.app

Works on mobile. No signup required.
