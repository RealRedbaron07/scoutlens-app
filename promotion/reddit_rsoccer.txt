**Title:** I Built a Free Tool to Find Undervalued Footballers - Here's What I Found

**Body:**

Hey r/soccer,

I've been working on a scouting tool called ScoutLens that uses market value estimates + xG data to find undervalued players. I thought you might find it interesting.

**What it does:**
- Tracks 300+ players across 25+ leagues
- Shows market value estimates based on performance data
- Calculates undervaluation % using xG/xGI
- Updates daily with live transfer rumors

**Some interesting findings:**
1. [PLAYER_NAME] is undervalued by [X]% - Market value €[VALUE]M but xG suggests [HIGHER_VALUE]M
2. [PLAYER_NAME] is undervalued by [X]% - [REASON]
3. [PLAYER_NAME] is undervalued by [X]% - [REASON]

**Try it free:** [YOUR_APP_URL]

No signup required. Just data. Let me know what you think!

**Note:** I'm not selling anything. This is completely free. Just sharing something I built that might be useful.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the feedback! I've updated the tool based on your suggestions:
